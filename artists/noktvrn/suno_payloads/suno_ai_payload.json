  "lyrics": "Digital shadows crawl across the screen\nNight falls on Neo-Tokyo, where nothing is what it seems\n808s rumble like distant thunder\nVHS memories torn asunder\n\nMidnight drive through neon rain\nDistorted faces feel no pain\nGlitched reality bends the mind\nLeave the physical world behind\nCowbells echo through empty malls\nDigital ghosts haunt these walls\nChopped vocals from another time\nSlowed down memories, sublime\n\nNØKTVRN calls when the city sleeps\nDrift through dimensions, take the leap\nStatic visions cloud your eyes\nAs the digital phantom flies\nNØKTVRN calls when the city sleeps\nDrift through dimensions, take the leap\n\nPurple haze obscures the street\nPhantom cars with no one to meet\nCorrupted data forms my soul\nFragmented pieces never whole\nMemphis flows through digital veins\nCyberpunk nights wash away stains\nDrifting through the void alone\nWhere broken code becomes my throne\n\nNØKTVRN calls when the city sleeps\nDrift through dimensions, take the leap\nStatic visions cloud your eyes\nAs the digital phantom flies\nNØKTVRN calls when the city sleeps\nDrift through dimensions, take the leap\n\nThe system crashes as dawn breaks\nAnother night the phantom takes\nEchoes fade into the void\nDigital existence destroyed\nUntil darkness falls again...",
