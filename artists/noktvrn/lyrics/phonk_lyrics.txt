[INTRO]  
Digital shadows crawl across the screen  
Night falls on Neo-Tokyo, where nothing is what it seems  
808s rumble like distant thunder  
VHS memories torn asunder  

[VERSE 1]  
Midnight drive through neon rain  
Distorted faces feel no pain  
Glitched reality bends the mind  
Leave the physical world behind  
Cowbells echo through empty malls  
Digital ghosts haunt these walls  
Chopped vocals from another time  
Slowed down memories, sublime  

[HOOK]  
NØKTVRN calls when the city sleeps  
Drift through dimensions, take the leap  
Static visions cloud your eyes  
As the digital phantom flies  
NØKTVRN calls when the city sleeps  
Drift through dimensions, take the leap  

[DROP]  
(Heavy 808 bass and aggressive cowbell pattern)  

[VERSE 2]  
Purple haze obscures the street  
Phantom cars with no one to meet  
Corrupted data forms my soul  
Fragmented pieces never whole  
Memphis flows through digital veins  
Cyberpunk nights wash away stains  
Drifting through the void alone  
Where broken code becomes my throne  

[BASS]  
(Deep distorted bassline with chopped Memphis rap sample)  

[HOOK]  
NØKTVRN calls when the city sleeps  
Drift through dimensions, take the leap  
Static visions cloud your eyes  
As the digital phantom flies  
NØKTVRN calls when the city sleeps  
Drift through dimensions, take the leap  

[OUTRO]  
The system crashes as dawn breaks  
Another night the phantom takes  
Echoes fade into the void  
Digital existence destroyed  
Until darkness falls again...
