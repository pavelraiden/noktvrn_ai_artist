Recovery Log - Phase 9 (Post Chat #30 Restore)

Date: 2025-05-11

System continuing execution after a full memory restore event (related to Chat #30 overflow and context consolidation).

Current Project State:
- Phase: 9 (Production Finalizer)
- Step: P18.5 (Correction Phase)

Completed actions prior to this log entry (as per restored and consolidated context):
- Full review of all provided archives, chat logs (up to #30), `pasted_content.txt` (master prompt), and other documentation.
- Identification of CRITICAL CORRECTION: All previously simulated Git operations and CI checks are invalid and have been conceptually rolled back.
- `dev_diary.md` updated to reflect the full context consolidation and the plan for real Git operations.
- `todo.md` updated to reflect the detailed plan post-consolidation.
- `project_context.md` in `live_noktvrn_repo` updated to reflect the corrected state and new Git Safety Protocol.

Actions to be taken (as per updated plan):
1.  This `recovery_log_phase9.txt` is being updated to reflect the current corrected state.
2.  Verify Git remote configuration (using PAT).
3.  Address any local unstaged changes before pulling.
4.  Pull latest changes from `origin feature/phase9-production-finalizer` with rebase.
5.  Run full local CI checks (`black .`, `flake8 .`, `pytest`).
6.  Systematically fix all CI errors found.
7.  Commit all fixes and updated documentation.
8.  Push to the feature branch.
9.  Verify GitHub Actions CI pass.
10. Notify user and await PR instructions.



**Update: 2025-05-11 (Continued)**

**Blocker:** Persistent parsing errors in `release_chain/release_manager.py`.

**Summary of Troubleshooting:**
- Multiple versions of `release_manager.py` were provided by the user (`release_manager_fixed.py`, `release_manager_final.py`, `release_manager_final_cleaned.py`, `release_manager_final_cleaned_v2.py`) to address syntax errors.
- Agent also attempted targeted fixes based on CI feedback (f-string quote issues, unterminated strings).
- Despite these efforts, `black .` formatter consistently fails to parse the file, typically at or after line 335 (e.g., `Cannot parse: 336:0: <line number missing in source>`). This suggests the file may still be truncated or contain malformed code towards the end.

**Current Status & Next Steps for Context Transfer/Resumption:**
1.  **Awaiting User Action:** The system has escalated to the user, requesting a complete, untruncated, and fully parsable version of `release_manager.py` that has been locally validated with `black .`.
2.  **Documentation Updated:** `dev_diary.md`, `todo.md`, and this `recovery_log_phase9.txt` have been updated to reflect the current situation and troubleshooting history.
3.  **Upon Receiving Corrected File:**
    *   Replace `/home/ubuntu/workspace/live_noktvrn_repo/release_chain/release_manager.py` with the new user-provided file.
    *   Run full local CI checks (`black .`, `flake8 .`, `pytest`).
4.  **If CI Passes:**
    *   Proceed with committing all fixes and updated documentation.
    *   Push changes to the `feature/phase9-production-finalizer` branch.
    *   Validate the push and CI status on GitHub.
    *   Report completion and send relevant files to the user.
5.  **If CI Fails Again:** Re-evaluate and potentially escalate again if the file remains unparsable.

This log ensures that if the session is transferred or reset, the next interaction can resume with full awareness of the current blocking issue and the steps taken so far.
