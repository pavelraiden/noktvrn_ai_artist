# Todo List - Phase 10.1: Production Server Setup & Infrastructure Deployment

This list outlines the steps for analyzing requirements, selecting hosting, planning infrastructure, configuring deployment, implementing lifecycle controls, and documenting the production setup.

- [X] 001 Analyze repository structure and estimate resource requirements for 100-300 artists.
- [ ] 002 Research hosting providers (Hetzner, Vultr, etc.) based on criteria (cost, performance, scaling, PostgreSQL).
- [ ] 003 Select hosting provider and document the decision rationale in `docs/deployment/provider_selection.md`.
- [ ] 004 Define server specifications, network config, DB setup, storage strategy, and document in `docs/deployment/infra_setup.md`. Create `/deployment/` directory.
- [ ] 005 Create deployment configuration (e.g., Docker Compose, setup scripts) in `/deployment/` for Flask backend/frontend, PostgreSQL, and potentially other services. Ensure secure `.env` handling.
- [ ] 006 Implement Artist Start/Pause logic in the Flask frontend (`frontend/app.py`, templates) and necessary backend interactions (e.g., API endpoints, state management).
- [ ] 007 Update documentation (`README.md`, `dev_diary.md`, `infra_setup.md`, potentially frontend README) with deployment steps, configuration details, lifecycle control usage, and security measures.
- [ ] 008 Perform final code review and security check of deployment scripts and configurations.
- [ ] 009 Commit all new/modified files (deployment scripts, frontend code, documentation).
- [ ] 010 Synchronize changes to GitHub.
- [ ] 011 (Simulated) Verify deployment: Document expected verification steps for endpoints, DB, Telegram bot, and dashboard functionality.
- [ ] 012 Prepare final report summarizing actions, chosen infrastructure, estimated costs, and deployment status.
- [ ] 013 Send final report and deliverables to the user.
