# Production Finalizer & Structure Auditor Task List

This file tracks the progress of the Production Finalizer & Structure Auditor task.

## Phase 1: Audit & Restructuring

- [ ] **001: Traverse Repository:** Systematically review every module and folder in `/home/ubuntu/ai_artist_system_clone`.
- [X] **002: Remove Deprecated Files:** Identify and remove unused files, including any remaining Luma references (Plan Step 004).
- [X] **003: Validate `services/` Directory:** Confirm the `services/` directory exists and contains the necessary service files (`artist_db_service.py`, `video_editing_service.py`, `trend_analysis_service.py`) implemented previously. (Plan Step 005 - Adjusted from "Restore").
- [X] **004: Validate Import Logic:** Check `import` statements across all modules for correctness and consistency, ensuring no broken imports (Plan Step 006).
- [X] **005: Simulate System Boot:** Perform a dry run or simulation of the system startup, focusing on the core components (`batch_runner`, `llm_orchestrator`, `release_chain`, `services/artist_db_service.py`) to catch initialization errors (Plan Step 006).
- [X] **006: Rewrite Documentation:** Update `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md`, and `docs/development/dev_diary.md` to accurately reflect the current production-ready state (v1.2 + new features) (Plan Step 007).
- [ ] **007: Update `todo.md`:** Replace the existing `todo.md` with this new task list.
- [ ] **008: Merge Future Enhancements:** Consolidate all "Future Enhancements" sections from various documents into a single list (Plan Step 013).
- [ ] **009: Implement Useful Enhancements:** (Requires User Input) Review the merged list and implement only the enhancements deemed truly useful for production (Plan Step 013).

## Phase 2: Feature Implementation

- [S] **010: Implement Telegram Control Panel:** Set up Telegram bot integration using provided credentials. Implement message format (artist, stage, preview, buttons) and response handling (Plan Step 008). SKIPPED due to technical issues.
- [X] **011: Implement LLM Fallback Logic:** Modify `llm_orchestrator` to handle ranked model lists and implement fallback mechanism on errors, with Telegram notifications (Plan Step 009).
- [X] **012: Implement Error Analysis & Auto-Fixing:** Set up error logging, create Log Analyzer LLM function, Engineer LLM function, Git integration for patching, and Telegram notifications for human intervention (Plan Step 010).
- [X] **013: Implement Autopilot/Manual Control:** Add flag to artist profile/DB, modify `batch_runner` to check flag, implement Telegram toggle command, adjust execution flow based on mode (Plan Step 011).

## Phase 3: Validation & Finalization

- [ ] **014: Deep Architecture Validation & Linting:** Perform code review, remove dead/duplicate code, enforce formatting (e.g., `black`), and ensure consistent docstrings, focusing on core modules (Plan Step 012).
- [ ] **015: Test Production Boot:** Verify system startup and basic operation via Telegram commands and manual CLI execution (Plan Step 014).
- [ ] **016: Create Final Audit Report:** Document all changes, audit findings, implemented features, testing results, and remaining issues (Plan Step 015).
- [ ] **017: Commit & Push Changes:** Commit all finalized code and documentation to the GitHub repository (Plan Step 016).

## Phase 4: Completion

- [ ] **018: Notify User:** Inform the user of task completion and provide the final report (Plan Step 017).
