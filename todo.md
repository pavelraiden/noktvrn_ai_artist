# AI Artist Platform - Finalization Task List (v1.5)

This file tracks the progress of the final production readiness tasks for the AI Artist Platform, including the implementation of full artist lifecycle logic.

## Phase 1: Core Fixes & Restoration (Completed)

- [X] **001: Fix `ModuleNotFoundError`:** Analyze and fix import paths or `sys.path` issues preventing `batch_runner/artist_batch_runner.py` from finding the `services` module. Test local execution.
- [X] **002: Restore `trend_analysis_service.py`:** Locate previously written code (if available) and add the file to the `services/` directory. Integrate if necessary.
- [X] **003: Implement/Restore `artist_lifecycle_manager.py`:** Locate code or implement logic for artist lifecycle management (performance tracking, retirement triggers if not already fully covered by `batch_runner` and `artist_db_service`). Integrate appropriately.
- [ ] **004: Clarify `artist_creator/` Status:** Investigate the removal/integration of the `artist_creator/` directory and update documentation (README, architecture diagrams) to reflect the current structure. (Moved to Phase 6)

## Phase 2: Feature Implementation & Enhancement (Completed)

- [X] **005: Implement LLM Auto-Repair:** Enhance `services/error_analysis_service.py` with full analysis, fix generation, testing, Telegram confirmation logic, and conditional `git apply` integration. Refine error logging in core modules.
- [X] **006: Document API Key Requirements:** Analyze `trend_analysis_service.py` and lifecycle management logic to determine specific external API needs (sources, endpoints, scopes). Document the requirements and acquisition process.
- [X] **007: Design Streamlit UI Upgrade:** Analyze the provided Dribbble link. Create a UI/UX specification (`docs/ui_ux_spec.md`) for a production-grade dashboard. Recommend an LLM for code generation.

## Phase 3: Documentation Completion (Completed)

- [X] **008: Update `README.md` - Env Vars:** Add a detailed section explaining all variables in `.env.example` (required, optional, defaults).
- [X] **009: Update `README.md` - LLM & Launch:** Document the LLM chain (roles, fallback, auto-repair) and add detailed local/Docker launch instructions.
- [X] **010: Document Telegram Bot UX:** Create `docs/telegram_bot_ux.md` detailing commands, workflow, and interactions.
- [X] **011: Update `dev_diary.md`:** Add entries summarizing the finalization phase activities.
- [ ] **012: Update `project_context.md`:** (If exists) Update with the final system state, or create a summary document. (Moved to Phase 6)

## Phase 4: Repository Audit & Cleanup (Completed)

- [X] **013: Audit & Cleanup Repository:** Perform a final review to remove dead code, unused files. Ensure `.gitignore` is correct.

## Phase 5: Artist Lifecycle Implementation

- [ ] **001: Analyze existing artist lifecycle logic:** Review `services/artist_lifecycle_manager.py` and related modules (e.g., `artist_db_service.py`, `batch_runner.py`) to understand current capabilities. (Plan Step 002)
- [ ] **002: Design modular lifecycle triggers:** Define specific metrics (performance, inactivity, trend scores) and thresholds for creation, evolution, and retirement/pausing. (Plan Step 003)
- [ ] **003: Implement artist creation logic:** Develop the mechanism for generating new artist profiles/configurations. (Plan Step 004)
- [ ] **004: Implement artist evolution logic:** Develop the mechanism for modifying artist parameters based on performance metrics. (Plan Step 005)
- [ ] **005: Implement artist retirement/pausing logic:** Develop the mechanism for deactivating or pausing artists based on defined criteria. (Plan Step 006)
- [ ] **006: Integrate lifecycle logic with batch runner:** Modify `batch_runner/artist_batch_runner.py` to call lifecycle management functions at appropriate points. (Plan Step 007)
- [D] **007: Validate lifecycle logic with test cases:** Create and run tests to ensure creation, evolution, and retirement work as expected. (Plan Step 011 - DEFERRED until manual fix)
- [ ] **008: Document lifecycle in `dev_diary.md`:** Add detailed entries explaining the implemented lifecycle logic, triggers, and metrics. (Plan Step 009)
- [ ] **009: Update/Create artist profile documentation:** Create or update documentation detailing the artist profile structure, parameters, and lifecycle states. (Plan Step 010)

## Phase 6: Comprehensive Audit & Documentation Revision

- [ ] **010: Audit repository structure and codebase:** Perform a full review, including clarifying the status of `artist_creator/` (Old Todo 004) and removing any dead code/unused files. (Plan Step 011)
- [ ] **011: Revise *all* documentation files:** Update `README.md`, `dev_diary.md`, `docs/`, etc., to ensure consistency and accuracy with the final codebase, including lifecycle logic. Update `project_context.md` (Old Todo 012). (Plan Step 012)
- [X] **012: Finalize remaining TODOs and cleanup:** Address any outstanding TODO comments in the code or documentation. (Plan Step 016)

## Phase 7: Finalization & Delivery

- [X] **013: Validate environment variable files:** Ensure `.env` and `.env.example` are complete and correct. (Plan Step 017)
- [ ] **014: Conduct final system tests:** Execute `boot_test.py` and a full test cycle of `batch_runner/artist_batch_runner.py` including lifecycle logic. (Plan Step 015)
- [ ] **015: Report missing API keys/credentials:** List any remaining API keys or credentials needed from the user. (Plan Step 016)
- [ ] **016: Commit and push all changes to GitHub:** Stage, commit, and push the final, clean repository structure. (Plan Step 017)
- [ ] **017: Generate and send final report:** Create a report summarizing all actions, final state, and any remaining notes. (Plan Step 018)
