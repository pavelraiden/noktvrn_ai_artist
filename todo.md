# Phase 9 Todo List

- [x] **suno_orchestrator.py / run_orchestrator.py**: Enhance retry logic, ensure robust fallback mechanisms, make chain execution modular and failsafe, add explicit test triggers if necessary to validate fallback paths. (Completed in step 009)
- [x] **release_chain/**: Implement the release chain workflow: status → preview → approve → upload. (Completed in step 010)
- [x] **streamlit_ui/**: Update Streamlit UI to check pipeline metadata and render status from the release chain. (Completed in step 011)
- [ ] **Simulate Live Execution**: Run `release_manager.py` to generate test data and then launch `streamlit_ui/app.py` to verify status display. (Current step 012)
- [ ] **Finalize all docs + logs**: Update `dev_diary.md`, `action_log.md`, and create `final_report.md` summarizing Phase 9 work.
- [ ] **CI Checks**: Run all local CI checks (Flake8, Black, Pytest, etc.) and ensure they pass.
- [ ] **Push all Phase 9 work to feature/phase9-production-finalizer**: Commit all changes and push to the designated feature branch.
- [ ] **Report full status and ask for Phase 10 clearance**
