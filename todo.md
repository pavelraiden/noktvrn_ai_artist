# Finalization & Production-Sync Task - Todo List

This list tracks the steps required to finalize the AI Artist Platform repository for production deployment based on the instructions received on 2025-05-01.

## 1. Git Push Fix
- [x] 001: Configure Git with the new token (`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`).
- [x] 002: Attempt to push the previous commit (`f5fae27`) to `origin/main`.
- [x] 003: Verify push success, including `.github/workflows/ci.yml` update.
- [ ] 004: (Contingency) If push fails, diagnose and apply necessary fixes (e.g., reset, recommit, force push if needed and safe).

## 2. Repository Audit & Cleanup
- [x] 005: Review current folder structure (`noktvrn_ai_artist/`, `streamlit_app/`, `docs/`, etc.).
- [x] 006: Identify unused/deprecated modules, scripts, and placeholder files (e.g., check older modules like `artist_builder`, `artist_creator`, `artist_manager`, `artist_flow`).
- [x] 007: Verify module connectivity and ensure core components (`llm_orchestrator`, `batch_runner`, `release_chain`, `api_clients`, `metrics`) are integrated.
- [x] 008: Remove hardcoded Luma API usage (confirm removal from `api_clients/luma_client.py`, `batch_runner`, etc.).
- [x] 009: Delete identified unused/placeholder files/folders (e.g., `dummy_keys`, `temp/`, `old_code/`, stale modules if confirmed removable). *Note: Keep `todo.md` until task completion.*
- [x] 010: Verify `.env` contains real keys and no dummy placeholders remain (visual check).

## 3. GitHub Actions CI
- [x] 011: Check/Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- [x] 012: Add CI steps: Code formatting (e.g., Black), Linting (e.g., Flake8), Tests (e.g., pytest execution).
- [x] 013: Add CI step: Validate `.env.example` presence in key directories (`/`, `batch_runner/`, `release_chain/`, `streamlit_app/`).
- [ ] 014: (Optional) Add CI step: Detect unused/misplaced files (if feasible).

## 4. LLM Ecosystem Health Evaluation
- [x] 015: Review `llm_orchestrator.py` structure, provider logic, and fallback mechanism.
- [x] 016: Assess conceptual efficiency of model usage (primary/fallback sequence).
- [ ] 017: Log evaluation (stability score 1-10, weak links, improvements) in `docs/development/dev_diary.md`.

## 5. Documentation Update
- [ ] 018: Update `README.md` with final production state, CI badge (once working), and refined setup/usage instructions.
- [ ] 019: Update `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md` reflecting CI process and cleanup standards.
- [ ] 020: Update `docs/project_context.md` with a summary of the final production-ready state.
- [ ] 021: Add a detailed entry for the "Finalization & Production-Sync" phase in `docs/development/dev_diary.md` (to be done *after* completing steps).

## 6. Final Production Sync Verification
- [ ] 022: Conceptually review core workflow (Batch Runner -> Release Chain -> Output) for closed-loop operation.
- [ ] 023: Verify LLM orchestrator fallback logic through code review.
- [ ] 024: Perform final check for overall repository cleanliness and production readiness.

## 7. Final Git Push & Reporting
- [ ] 025: Stage all final changes.
- [ ] 026: Commit changes with a descriptive message (e.g., "chore: Finalize repository for production sync v1.0").
- [ ] 027: Push final commit to `origin/main`.
- [ ] 028: Verify final push success.
- [ ] 029: Create a completion report summarizing the finalization process.
- [ ] 030: Notify user of completion.
