# AI Artist Platform - Phase 9: Final Production Patch Todo

This checklist outlines the tasks for the final production patch (Phase 9).

## 1. GitHub CI Fix

- [x] Identify the specific Black formatting error from the failed CI run (requires checking GitHub Actions logs - may need user input or browser access if not locally reproducible).
- [x] Run Black locally on the codebase: `black .` in the repo root.
- [x] Stage the reformatted files.
- [x] Commit the formatting fix: `git commit -m "fix: Apply Black formatting"`.
- [x] Push the fix to GitHub: `git push origin main`.
- [x] Verify the CI workflow now passes on GitHub.

## 2. API Key & Environment Sync

- [x] Re-verify `.env` file contains the correct production keys provided for Phase 9 (Suno, Pexels, Pixabay, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Mistral, Telegram Bot, Telegram Chat ID).
- [x] Confirm no dummy/placeholder keys remain in `.env`.
- [x] Re-verify `.env.example` accurately reflects all required keys with appropriate placeholders (including optional ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).
- [x] Double-check that all Luma-related keys (`LUMA_API_KEY`) and logic are completely removed from both `.env` and `.env.example`.
- [x] Briefly review key loading logic in major components (`llm_orchestrator`, `api_clients`) to ensure they still correctly use `dotenv`.

## 3. Full Repo Review & Architecture Cleanup

- [ ] Systematically review every folder and file in `/home/ubuntu/ai_artist_system_clone`.
- [ ] Ensure essential documentation (`README.md` or similar) exists in each core module directory.
- [ ] Update any outdated instructions, comments, or documentation identified during the review.
- [ ] Identify and remove any remaining deprecated files or unused code snippets.
- [ ] Improve code formatting, naming consistency, and file structure where necessary for clarity and production readiness.
- [ ] Pay special attention to logging configurations, path handling, and configuration loading mechanisms for consistency.

## 4. Documentation Finalization

- [ ] Update main `README.md` to reflect the final Production-Ready v1.1 state and architecture.
- [ ] Update `docs/project_context.md` to finalize the production vision and system overview.
- [ ] Add a detailed entry to `docs/development/dev_diary.md` logging the actions taken during Phase 9.
- [ ] Update `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md` with notes on the LLM auto-discovery mechanism and role handling.
- [ ] Review and update documentation within `docs/modules/` or individual module READMEs as needed based on the repo review.

## 5. Frontend UI Foundation

- [ ] Create the `/home/ubuntu/ai_artist_system_clone/frontend/` directory.
- [ ] Create a basic `frontend/README.md` explaining the purpose (admin panel) and future plans (Spotify-like styling).
- [ ] Create placeholder files/structure for a simple web UI (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit, depending on desired stack - choose Flask for now for a simple structure):
    - `frontend/app.py` (basic Flask app setup)
    - `frontend/requirements.txt` (add `Flask`)
    - `frontend/templates/` directory
    - `frontend/templates/index.html` (placeholder dashboard)
    - `frontend/templates/artists.html` (placeholder artist list)
    - `frontend/templates/stats.html` (placeholder stats view)
- [ ] Update the main `README.md` to mention the new `frontend` directory and its purpose.

## 6. Final GitHub Synchronization

- [ ] Verify Git is configured with the correct token: `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`.
- [ ] Stage all changes (`git add .`).
- [ ] Perform a final check:
    - [ ] No dummy API keys in committed code (check `.env.example`).
    - [ ] No major placeholder files/logic remain (except intentional UI placeholders).
    - [ ] Key documentation (`README.md`, `dev_diary.md`, `.env.example`) is up-to-date.
- [ ] Commit changes with a message indicating Phase 9 finalization and Production-Ready v1.1 status (e.g., `chore: Final production patch (Phase 9), repo cleanup, UI bootstrap. Production Ready v1.1`).
- [ ] Push changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.
- [ ] Verify the push was successful and check CI status on GitHub again.

## 7. Final Reporting

- [ ] Create a final completion report (`phase_9_completion_report.md`) summarizing all actions taken in Phase 9.
- [ ] Notify the user of completion, attaching the report and confirming Production-Ready v1.1 status.
