# AI Artist System - Code Health & Pytest Fixes (Ongoing)

## Phase: Release Chain Test Audit & Fixes

- [X] **Step 001: Review `release_chain` test failures** (Initial review of pytest output)
- [X] **Step 002: Read `tests/release_chain/test_release_chain.py`** (Full file content)
- [X] **Step 003: Analyze `release_chain/release_chain.py` implementation** (Full file content)
- [X] **Step 004: Identify discrepancies between tests and implementation** (Field name mismatches in mocks, global var access)
- [X] **Step 005: Manually correct test methods and imports (Initial pass)** (Scripted modification for mock field names)
- [X] **Step 006: Verify and update mocks and patch targets (Initial pass)** (Applied scripted changes)
- [X] **Step 007: Rerun `pytest` and collect new failures** (Revealed `AttributeError` for globals)
- [X] **Step 008: Fix `release_chain` test import and global access pattern**
    - [X] Updated `release_chain/__init__.py` to export globals.
    - [X] Attempted and reverted incorrect `release_chain.release_chain.VAR` access pattern in tests.
    - [X] Corrected access to `release_chain.VAR` in tests.
- [X] **Step 009: Rerun `pytest` and collect new failures** (Resolved import `AttributeError`s, `AssertionError`s remain in `release_chain`)
- [X] **Step 010: Document all fixes and rationale in `dev_diary.md`** (Logged progress and findings for `release_chain` initial fixes)

## Phase: Trend Analysis Service Test Audit & Fixes

- [X] **Step 011: Update `todo.md` progress** (Marked `release_chain` initial fixes)
- [X] **Step 012: Move to `trend_analysis_service` test failures**
- [X] **Step 013: Read `trend_analysis_service` test files**
- [X] **Step 014: Analyze `trend_analysis_service` implementation**
- [X] **Step 015: Align tests with actual API and logic for `trend_analysis_service`** (Commented out `sys.path.append` in service)
- [X] **Step 016: Correct mocks and patch targets for `trend_analysis_service`** (Identified missing `pytest-mock`)
- [X] **Step 017: Deeply audit `trend_analysis_service` test errors and tracebacks** (Confirmed `mocker` fixture missing)
- [X] **Step 018: Rerun `pytest` to verify all fixes** (Installed `pytest-mock`, all `trend_analysis_service` tests PASSED)
- [X] **Step 019: Document `trend_analysis_service` fixes in `dev_diary.md`** (Logged investigation and solution)

## Phase: Remaining Test Suite Audit & Fixes (Current)

- [ ] **Update `todo.md` progress** (This step)
- [ ] **Run `pytest` for the entire project to get a consolidated list of failures.**
- [ ] **Address `release_chain` remaining `AssertionError`s**
    - [ ] Analyze specific assertion failures.
    - [ ] Align test expectations with implementation logic (file paths, mock return values, etc.).
    - [ ] Rerun `pytest tests/release_chain/`.
- [ ] **Address `llm_orchestrator` test failures** (AttributeErrors, AssertionErrors, NameErrors, TypeErrors)
    - [ ] Analyze specific failures.
    - [ ] Correct method calls, mock setups, and exception handling in tests.
    - [ ] Rerun `pytest tests/llm_orchestrator/`.
- [ ] **Address `batch_runner` test failures** (ImportErrors)
    - [ ] Analyze import issues (likely related to `__init__.py` or circular dependencies).
    - [ ] Correct imports and package structure.
    - [ ] Rerun `pytest tests/batch_runner/`.
- [ ] **Iteratively fix and rerun `pytest` until all tests pass.**

## Phase: Finalization & Reporting

- [ ] **Finalize and document all work** (Comprehensive documentation update, including READMEs for each folder, core README, `docs/modules/orchestrator.md` for `OrchestrationResult`/`OrchestrationStatus`, `docs/todo/fallback_bas_integration.md`).
- [ ] **Ensure `.env.example` contains real demo API keys.**
- [ ] **Perform Git operations:**
    - [ ] Stage all changes.
    - [ ] Commit changes with a descriptive message (e.g., `fix: Resolve all pytest failures and update documentation`).
    - [ ] Push changes to the feature branch.
    - [ ] (If CI passes) Create PR and merge to `main` (following CI workflow requirements like `dev_diary_backup.md`).
- [ ] **Prepare and write final `report.txt`** (Summarizing all work done, issues found, fixes applied, and current state).
- [ ] **Notify user and send report.**
- [ ] **Enter idle state.**

## Ongoing Tasks:
- Continuously apply Git discipline: commit and push validated changes frequently (after significant, stable milestones).
- Maintain comprehensive documentation (READMEs, dev_diary.md, etc.).
- Operate in autonomous self-healing mode.
