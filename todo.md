# Todo List - Phase 11: Enhancement Pass

This list outlines the steps for implementing and documenting enhancements for the AI Artist Platform.

**I. Setup & Review**
- [X] 001 Create `todo.md` for Enhancement Pass. (This step)
- [X] 002 Review repository structure and identify target modules for enhancements.
- [X] 003 Double-check for any remaining Luma references in code or documentation.
- [X] 004 Review existing architecture (`docs/architecture/`, `README.md`) for potential flaws or areas needing updates based on enhancements.

**II. Core Enhancements (Data & LLM Focused)**
- [ ] 005 Implement Real-time Trend Scoring mechanism (e.g., in `analytics` or `artist_evolution`).
- [ ] 006 Implement Cross-step Trend Injection (e.g., modifying prompts in `artist_flow/generators` or `llm_orchestrator` based on trends).
- [ ] 007 Implement Persistent Memory per Role (e.g., storing role-specific context/history, potentially using files or DB integration via `database` module).
- [ ] 008 Implement Auto-reflection for LLMs during artist cycle (e.g., adding a reflection step in `batch_runner` or `llm_orchestrator`).
- [ ] 009 Implement LLM Prompt A/B Testing System (design and implement mechanism to test, track, and rank prompt performance).

**III. Feature Enhancements & Integration**
- [ ] 010 Implement Stable Video Editing & Stock Slicing Pipeline (refine/enhance `video_processing` module).
- [ ] 011 Finalize Artist Lifecycle Control (Start/Pause) in Admin Interface (verify/complete frontend (`deployment/dashboard.js`, `deployment/admin_dashboard.html`) and backend (`frontend/src/routes/artist.py`) integration from Phase 10.2).

**IV. Testing & Validation**
- [ ] 012 Test Trend Scoring and Injection functionality.
- [ ] 013 Test Persistent Memory implementation.
- [ ] 014 Test Auto-reflection mechanism.
- [ ] 015 Test Prompt A/B Testing system.
- [ ] 016 Test Video Editing Pipeline outputs.
- [ ] 017 Test Admin Lifecycle Control (Start/Pause buttons).
- [ ] 018 Perform end-to-end pipeline validation with all enhancements integrated.

**V. Documentation & Finalization**
- [ ] 019 Update `.env.example` with any new configuration variables introduced by enhancements.
- [ ] 020 Update main `README.md` to reflect v1.2 (or similar) status and new features.
- [ ] 021 Update `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md` with any new development principles or workflows.
- [ ] 022 Update `docs/development/dev_diary.md` with a summary of the Enhancement Pass.
- [ ] 023 Update module READMEs and documentation in `/docs/modules/` for components modified during this phase.
- [ ] 024 Create/Update documentation detailing the implemented enhancements (e.g., `docs/features/enhancements_v1_2.md`).
- [ ] 025 Review and update GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) if necessary (e.g., new tests, dependencies).
- [ ] 026 Perform final code review and cleanup.
- [ ] 027 Commit and push all changes to GitHub (`main` branch) using the provided token.
- [ ] 028 Prepare final report summarizing the Enhancement Pass, implemented features, and system status.
- [ ] 029 Send final report and confirmation (`âœ… Enhancement Pass complete. Git synced. Repo is clean and production-ready.`) to the user.
