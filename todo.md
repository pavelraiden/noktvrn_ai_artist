# Todo List - Phase 10.1: Production Server Setup & Infrastructure Deployment (Vultr)

This list outlines the steps for analyzing requirements, planning infrastructure on Vultr, configuring deployment, implementing lifecycle controls, and documenting the production setup.

- [X] 001 Analyze repository structure and estimate resource requirements for 100-300 artists. (Completed in previous plan)
- [X] 002 Document Vultr as selected provider and rationale in `docs/deployment/provider_selection.md`.
- [X] 003 Define Vultr server specifications, network config, DB setup (PostgreSQL), storage strategy, and document in `docs/deployment/infra_setup.md`. Create `/deployment/` directory.
- [X] 004 Create deployment configuration (e.g., Docker Compose, setup scripts) in `/deployment/` for Flask backend/frontend, PostgreSQL, and other services on Vultr. Ensure secure `.env` handling.
- [X] 005 Implement Artist Start/Pause logic in the Flask frontend (`frontend/app.py`, templates) and necessary backend interactions (e.g., API endpoints, state management). # Backend API done, UI/Integration pending
- [X] 006 Update documentation (`README.md`, `dev_diary.md`, `infra_setup.md`, `provider_selection.md`, frontend README) with Vultr deployment steps, configuration details, lifecycle control usage, and security measures.
- [X] 007 Perform final code review and security check of deployment scripts and configurations.
- [ ] 008 Commit all new/modified files (deployment scripts, frontend code, documentation).
- [ ] 009 Synchronize changes to GitHub.
- [X] 010 (Simulated) Verify deployment: Document expected verification steps for Vultr endpoints, DB, Telegram bot, and dashboard functionality.
- [ ] 011 Prepare final report summarizing actions, chosen Vultr infrastructure, estimated costs, and deployment status.
- [ ] 012 Send final report and deliverables to the user.
