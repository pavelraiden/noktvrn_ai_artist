## Production Readiness Tasks (Post-Audit - Plan Step 008 onwards)

**I. Critical Feature Integration & Core Logic Implementation:**
- [ ] **Suno BAS Integration:**
  - [ ] Merge `feature/bas-suno-orchestration` branch into `main`.
  - [ ] Conduct thorough testing of Suno BAS integration (functionality, error handling, fallback).
  - [ ] Update `services/beat_service.py` and `llm_orchestrator/` to fully utilize BAS flow.
  - [ ] Document Suno BAS integration in `docs/modules/suno_client.md` (or new BAS doc) and `AI_Artist_Platform_Architecture.md`.
- [ ] **TUNOC/Distribution Service Integration:**
  - [ ] Design the integration with TUNOC/TuneCore (or selected distribution service).
  - [ ] Implement the core logic in `/release_uploader/release_uploader.py` (currently placeholder).
  - [ ] Define clear interfaces and data formats for distribution.
  - [ ] Document the distribution process in `docs/modules/release_uploader.md` and `AI_Artist_Platform_Architecture.md`.
- [ ] **Batch Runner Core Logic Completion:**
  - [ ] Implement `generate_track` function in `batch_runner/artist_batch_runner.py` using the integrated Suno BAS flow.
  - [ ] Implement `select_video` function for robust video selection/generation.
  - [ ] Implement `get_adapted_parameters` for dynamic parameter adjustment.
- [ ] **Shell-Based User Interface:**
  - [ ] Define detailed requirements and design specifications for the shell-based UI (operations, monitoring, admin tasks).
  - [ ] Implement the core shell UI components.
  - [ ] Plan for deprecation/removal of `/dashboard/` (Streamlit) and `/frontend/` (Flask) if fully superseded.

**II. Module Enhancements & Verification:**
- [ ] **LLM Orchestrator Verification & Refinement:**
  - [ ] Verify all fixes from `llm_orchestrator_fixes_summary` (MistralChatMessage, fallbacks, notifications, async chain validation) are correctly merged and active in `main`.
  - [ ] Conduct targeted tests for LLM fallback chains and error handling.
  - [ ] Update `llm_orchestrator/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/modules/llm_orchestrator.md`.
- [ ] **API Client Completion:**
  - [ ] Review, complete, and test `api_clients/pexels_client.py`.
  - [ ] Review, complete, and test `api_clients/alt_music_client.py`.
  - [ ] Review, complete, and test `api_clients/spotify_client.py` and its use in `data_pipelines/`.
- [ ] **Video Generation/Selection Logic:**
  - [ ] Enhance `/video_processing/` modules for robust video selection or basic generation.
  - [ ] Integrate fully with `batch_runner.select_video`.
- [ ] **Trend Analysis Integration:**
  - [ ] Ensure data from `spotify_charts_pipeline.py` is effectively used in artist evolution or content strategy.
  - [ ] Document the end-to-end trend analysis flow and its impact.
- [ ] **API Endpoints (`api/main.py`):**
  - [ ] Uncomment and implement necessary API endpoints if required for shell UI backend or external integrations.
  - [ ] Secure API endpoints if they are to be exposed.
- [ ] **Artist Lifecycle Management:**
  - [ ] Review `services/artist_lifecycle_manager.py` against CORE doc for any advanced evolution/self-correction logic required.
- [ ] **Release Chain Safety & Robustness:**
  - [ ] Review `release_chain.py` for loop prevention, error handling in stages, unique ID logging, and JSON validation as per knowledge module.
- [ ] **OrchestrationResult/Status Standardization:**
  - [ ] Finalize and document `OrchestrationResult` and `OrchestrationStatus` structures as canonical in `docs/modules/orchestrator.md` or a dedicated design document.

**III. Documentation, Testing & CI/CD:**
- [ ] **Comprehensive Documentation Update:**
  - [ ] Review and update/archive all documents in the `docs/` subdirectories for accuracy and relevance.
  - [ ] Ensure a single, canonical `README.md` exists at the project root and is comprehensive.
  - [ ] Update module-specific READMEs and documentation (e.g., `docs/modules/*`).
- [ ] **Test Coverage Expansion:**
  - [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all new features (Suno BAS, TUNOC, Shell UI backend logic).
  - [ ] Increase coverage for existing critical modules (`batch_runner`, `llm_orchestrator`, `services`).
  - [ ] Define and (if possible) automate end-to-end testing scenarios.
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements:**
  - [ ] Consider adding security scanning tools (e.g., Bandit, Snyk) to the CI pipeline.
  - [ ] Explore adding automated deployment triggers for successful `main` branch builds (once deployment strategy is clear).

**IV. General Production Readiness:**
- [ ] **Configuration Management:**
  - [ ] Ensure `.env.example` files are present and accurate for all components requiring configuration.
  - [ ] Define and document the process for secure management of production API keys and credentials.
- [ ] **Deployment Strategy:**
  - [ ] Finalize and document the production deployment strategy (e.g., Docker containers, orchestration platform like K8s if applicable).
  - [ ] Update `deployment/docker-compose.yml` if it is part of the strategy.
- [ ] **Logging, Monitoring & Alerting:**
  - [ ] Define a centralized logging strategy for production.
  - [ ] Implement basic monitoring for key application metrics and system health.
  - [ ] Set up alerting for critical errors or system failures.
- [ ] **Backup and Recovery:**
  - [ ] Define and document a backup plan for `data/artists.db` and any other critical persistent data/assets.
  - [ ] Outline a recovery procedure in case of data loss or system failure.
- [ ] **Security Review:**
  - [ ] Conduct a basic security review of the codebase, dependencies, and data handling practices.

**V. Final Steps for This Synchronization Task:**
- [ ] **Step 8: Commit and Push Changes (Plan Step 009)**
  - [ ] Initialize Git in `noktvrn_ai_artist-main/noktvrn_ai_artist-main/` if needed (should be an extracted repo).
  - [ ] Add all changes (updated `docs/architecture/AI_Artist_Platform_Architecture.md`, `dev_diary.md`, and this `todo.md`).
  - [ ] Commit changes with message: `chore(docs): full sync audit, updated architecture, dev_diary, and todo for production readiness`.
  - [ ] Configure remote to `https://github.com/pavelraiden/noktvrn_ai_artist.git`.
  - [ ] Push the changes to the `main` branch.
- [ ] **Step 9: Report Completion (Plan Step 010)**
  - [ ] Notify the user of completion of the audit and documentation update phase.
  - [ ] Attach the updated `docs/architecture/AI_Artist_Platform_Architecture.md`, `dev_diary.md`, and this `todo.md` file.
