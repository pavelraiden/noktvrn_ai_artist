# Todo List - Phase 10.2: Production Server Deployment (Vultr Execution)

This list outlines the execution steps for deploying the AI Artist Platform directly onto the Vultr production server (136.244.94.146).

**Server Setup & Security:**
- [X] 001 Provision Vultr server (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, SSD, Ubuntu 24.04) via API in Frankfurt region. (Deviation: Ubuntu 24.04 used instead of 22.04)
- [X] 002 Configure Vultr firewall rules (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS) via API.
- [ ] 003 Establish SSH connection to the server (136.244.94.146) using provided credentials.
- [ ] 004 Perform initial server setup: update packages, set hostname/timezone (if needed).
- [ ] 005 Install Python 3.11 globally.
- [ ] 006 Install security tools: `fail2ban`, `ufw`.
- [ ] 007 Configure `ufw` firewall rules (allow SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, potentially PostgreSQL if needed remotely).
- [ ] 008 Harden SSH: disable root login, enable key-based auth (requires user key), configure `fail2ban` for SSH.

**Database Setup:**
- [ ] 009 Install and configure PostgreSQL server.
- [ ] 010 Create production database (`ai_artist_db`) and user (`ai_artist_user`) with a strong password.
- [ ] 011 Secure PostgreSQL configuration (e.g., restrict remote access if not needed).

**Application Deployment:**
- [ ] 012 Install Git and clone the `noktvrn_ai_artist` repository.
- [ ] 013 Set up Python virtual environment and install project dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
- [ ] 014 Create and populate the production `.env` file with provided API keys and DB credentials. Ensure no placeholders remain.
- [ ] 015 Install Nginx and Gunicorn.
- [ ] 016 Configure Gunicorn to serve the Flask frontend application.
- [ ] 017 Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for Gunicorn, handling static files and proxying requests.
- [ ] 018 Set up HTTPS using Let's Encrypt (Certbot) or a self-signed certificate.
- [ ] 019 Configure Systemd or Supervisor to manage Gunicorn (frontend) and the backend orchestrator/batch runner process for auto-start on boot.

**Functionality & Testing:**
- [ ] 020 Implement/Verify Artist Start/Pause logic integration in the Flask frontend UI and backend API.
- [ ] 021 Enable and test Telegram preview functionality (using provided bot token and chat ID).
- [ ] 022 Test the core LLM chain functionality.
- [ ] 023 Run a full test cycle for one artist and verify output (media generation, DB updates, logs).
- [ ] 024 Verify trend analysis and auto-role selection mechanisms.
- [ ] 025 Verify analytics layer support for 100-300 artists.
- [ ] 026 Verify admin panel functionality (artist cards, stats, start/pause, output summary).

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- [ ] 027 Configure application logging to `/var/log/ai_artist/`.
- [ ] 028 Set up log rotation for application logs.
- [ ] 029 Ensure error logging and traceability for failed processes.

**Finalization & Documentation:**
- [ ] 030 Perform production hardening: remove dev scripts, secure sensitive files (`.env`, `.ssh`, logs).
- [ ] 031 Review architecture and fix any identified flaws.
- [ ] 032 Ensure Luma references are completely removed.
- [ ] 033 Create/Update deployment scripts or configurations in the local `/deployment/` directory based on the server setup.
- [ ] 034 Commit and push final deployment configurations and any necessary code changes to GitHub.
- [ ] 035 Update documentation (`README.md`, `infra_setup.md`, `dev_diary.md`, `project_context.md`, `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md`) with final server details, deployment steps, access URL, and operational procedures.
- [ ] 036 Confirm system is live, accessible via the public URL, and services are running correctly.
- [ ] 037 Perform self-evaluation: Is the system production-grade?
- [ ] 038 Prepare final report summarizing the deployment process, server details, access URL, status, and self-evaluation.
- [ ] 039 Send final report and deliverables to the user.
