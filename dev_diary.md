## 2025-05-05 23:01 UTC - LLM Orchestrator Finalization & CI/CD Update

**Context:** Resumed LLM Orchestrator finalization after context switch and self-restoration. Encountered missing files and dependencies, recreated test file, installed missing packages (`openai`, `google-generativeai`, `mistralai`, `anthropic`, `python-dotenv`, `pytest-asyncio`). Iteratively fixed numerous test failures related to:
*   Module imports (`dotenv`, `openai`, `google.generativeai`, `mistralai`, `anthropic`, `llm_orchestrator.exceptions`).
*   Incorrect error message assertions (`ConfigurationError`).
*   Incorrect exception signatures for mocked errors (`RateLimitError`, `APIError`, `APIStatusError`, `InternalServerError`).
*   Incorrect assertion logic for fallback notifications (count and content).
*   Syntax errors introduced during fixes.

**Changes:**
*   `llm_orchestrator/orchestrator.py`: Corrected import paths for exceptions, added Suno handling in `_initialize_client` and fallback loop.
*   `tests/llm_orchestrator/test_orchestrator.py`: Recreated file, installed dependencies, fixed multiple assertion errors related to error signatures and notification content/count. Ensured all 9 tests pass.
*   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Extended workflow to include automatic PR creation and merge for feature branches after successful CI. Added steps for backing up `dev_diary.md`, using PAT for auth, and enabling auto-merge. Configured dummy API keys for test environment.

**Validation:** All 9 tests in `tests/llm_orchestrator/test_orchestrator.py` passed locally after fixes.

**Next Steps:** Push feature branch to trigger CI/CD workflow for automated PR creation and merge to `main`. Monitor workflow execution.
