[2025-05-08] ✍️ Architectural audit completed and integrated.
- Added docs/architecture/AI_Artist_Platform_Architecture.md
- All agents must now follow this blueprint for future logic, branching, and validation.



[2025-05-08] ✍️ **Full Synchronization Audit & Production Readiness Review (Phase Pre-Release)**

- **Objective:** Performed a comprehensive synchronization audit to establish a clear baseline for production readiness. This involved a deep dive into the current `main` branch (sourced from `noktvrn_ai_artist-main.zip`), cross-referencing with `AI Artist CORE doc (1).txt`, detailed chat logs from previous sessions (#46, #47 including `llm_orchestrator_fixes_summary_20250508_0224UTC.txt`), and existing documentation.
- **Process:**
    - Extracted and reviewed all provided materials, including chat logs and the repository HEAD.
    - Conducted a full repository traversal and initial review, logging findings in `repo_traversal_notes.md`.
    - Performed a detailed gap analysis comparing the CORE doc, existing architecture, chat log insights (including features on other branches), and the actual code in `main`.
    - Updated the primary architecture document (`docs/architecture/AI_Artist_Platform_Architecture.md`) to reflect all findings, identified gaps, and user requirements (e.g., shell-based UI, TUNOC integration).
- **Key Findings & Gaps Addressed in Architecture Document:**
    - **Suno BAS Integration:** Critical feature on `feature/bas-suno-orchestration` branch; not yet in `main`. Integration is a top priority.
    - **TUNOC/Distribution Service:** Required per CORE doc, currently missing. Placeholder in `/release_uploader/` needs to become a full integration plan.
    - **User Interface:** Confirmed user preference for a shell-based UI, deprecating previous Streamlit/Flask frontend plans in the architecture.
    - **LLM Orchestrator:** Verified the need to confirm all recent fixes (MistralChatMessage, fallbacks, notifications) are active in `main`.
    - **Conceptual Agent Roles:** Mapped CORE doc roles (Manus, Critic, Validator, Composer) to current/planned modules.
    - **Database:** Noted CORE doc mention of "future database" while acknowledging current SQLite use.
    - **CI/CD:** Existing CI is good; noted areas for potential enhancement.
    - **Documentation:** Identified need for consolidation and ensuring `AI_Artist_Platform_Architecture.md` is the central source of truth. Addressed missing root `README.md` (found nested).
    - **Placeholders:** Highlighted incomplete core logic in `batch_runner` and `api_clients`.
- **Outcome:** The `docs/architecture/AI_Artist_Platform_Architecture.md` has been significantly updated to serve as the definitive guide for the current state and roadmap to production. This audit provides a clear action plan for the next development phase.
- **Next Steps (Post-Audit):** Update `TODO.md` with actionable items from the audit, commit all changes, and prepare for targeted development to address identified gaps.
