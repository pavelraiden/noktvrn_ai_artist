# üìú Contribution Guide for AI Artist Creation and Management System

Welcome to the AI Artist Creation and Management System project!  
This guide describes the mandatory rules for contributing to the project to maintain high quality, scalability, and modularity.

---

## üõ° General Principles

- **Full Project Awareness**  
  Always check the full project structure and state before starting or completing any task.
  
- **Integration and Consistency**  
  Every new module, file, or function must integrate smoothly with the existing system.

- **Improvement Mindset**  
  Actively refactor or improve parts of the system if you notice optimization opportunities, conflicts, or outdated patterns.

- **Push Policy**  
  Push every meaningful change to GitHub after:
  - Checking project consistency
  - Verifying modular structure
  - Confirming no conflicts
  
- **Modular and Scalable Design**  
  Code must be modular, scalable, clean, and ready for future expansions without major rewrites.

- **Self-Learning Enhancement**  
  Every contribution must aim to improve the system's ability to self-learn, self-adapt, and self-optimize over time based on performance data and feedback.

- **Documentation Maintenance**
  - Always check `/TODO.md` before starting a new big module.
  - Always update `/docs/project_context.md` after major structural changes.
  - Always update `/docs/development/dev_diary.md` after completing tricky tasks.
  - Always reflect lessons and decisions in `/docs/development/solutions_catalog.md` and `/docs/development/lessons_learned.md`.

## üß© Adding New Modules or Features

When adding new modules or features to the system, follow these guidelines:

1. **Module Placement**
   - Place new modules in the appropriate top-level directory based on functionality
   - Create new top-level directories only when functionality doesn't fit existing categories
   - Follow the established naming conventions for directories and files

2. **Module Structure**
   - Each module should have a clear, single responsibility
   - Include a `README.md` file explaining the module's purpose and usage
   - Implement proper error handling and logging
   - Add appropriate unit and integration tests

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - Define clear interfaces for interaction with other modules
   - Use dependency injection where appropriate to maintain loose coupling
   - Document all public APIs and integration points
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing modules

4. **Approval Process**
   - Create a detailed proposal for significant new modules
   - Include justification, architecture design, and integration plan
   - Submit for review before implementation begins
   - Address all feedback before merging

## üìù Coding Conventions

### Naming Conventions

- **Files and Directories**
  - Use snake_case for Python files and directories: `artist_profile_generator.py`
  - Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose

- **Classes**
  - Use PascalCase for class names: `ArtistProfileGenerator`
  - Class names should be nouns or noun phrases

- **Functions and Methods**
  - Use snake_case for function and method names: `generate_artist_profile()`
  - Function names should be verbs or verb phrases
  - Boolean functions should start with `is_`, `has_`, or similar: `is_valid_profile()`

- **Variables**
  - Use snake_case for variable names: `artist_profile`
  - Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
  - Avoid single-letter variables except in short loops

- **Constants**
  - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants: `DEFAULT_GENRE_COUNT`

### Docstring Format

All modules, classes, and functions must include docstrings following this format:

```python
"""
Brief description of the function/class.

Detailed description explaining the purpose, behavior,
and any important information.

Args:
    param1 (type): Description of param1.
    param2 (type): Description of param2.

Returns:
    type: Description of return value.

Raises:
    ExceptionType: When and why this exception is raised.

Example:
    >>> example_usage()
    expected_result
"""
```
