# ðŸ“œ Contribution Guide for Artist Creator Platform

Welcome to the Artist Creator Project!  
This guide describes the mandatory rules for contributing to the project to maintain high quality, scalability, and modularity.

---

## ðŸ›¡ General Principles

- **Full Project Awareness**  
  Always check the full project structure and state before starting or completing any task.
  
- **Integration and Consistency**  
  Every new module, file, or function must integrate smoothly with the existing system.

- **Improvement Mindset**  
  Actively refactor or improve parts of the system if you notice optimization opportunities, conflicts, or outdated patterns.

- **Push Policy**  
  Push every meaningful change to GitHub after:
  - Checking project consistency
  - Verifying modular structure
  - Confirming no conflicts
  
- **Modular and Scalable Design**  
  Code must be modular, scalable, clean, and ready for future expansions without major rewrites.
