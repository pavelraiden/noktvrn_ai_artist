# üìú Contribution Guide for Artist Creator Platform

Welcome to the Artist Creator Project!  
This guide describes the mandatory rules for contributing to the project to maintain high quality, scalability, and modularity.

---

## üõ° General Principles

- **Full Project Awareness**  
  Always check the full project structure and state before starting or completing any task.
  
- **Integration and Consistency**  
  Every new module, file, or function must integrate smoothly with the existing system.

- **Improvement Mindset**  
  Actively refactor or improve parts of the system if you notice optimization opportunities, conflicts, or outdated patterns.

- **Push Policy**  
  Push every meaningful change to GitHub after:
  - Checking project consistency
  - Verifying modular structure
  - Confirming no conflicts
  
- **Modular and Scalable Design**  
  Code must be modular, scalable, clean, and ready for future expansions without major rewrites.

- **Self-Learning Enhancement**  
  Every contribution must aim to improve the system's ability to self-learn, self-adapt, and self-optimize over time based on performance data and feedback.

## üìÇ Project Structure Overview

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `artist_builder/` | Artist prompt creation, validation, profile assembly |
| `artist_flow/` | Artist creation workflow and asset management |
| `artists/` | Generated artist data and assets |
| `llm_orchestrator/` | Session management, logging, LLM orchestration |
| `scripts/` | Utility scripts for content and video generation |
| `templates/` | Template files for generation |
| `video_gen_config/` | Video generation configuration |

## üßπ Quality Standards

- Maintain clear separation of concerns.
- Use clean and descriptive naming.
- Avoid redundant code or duplicate logic.
- Follow best practices for error handling.
- Ensure reusability where appropriate.
- Implement comprehensive logging for performance analysis.
- Include metrics collection for self-optimization.

---

## üîÑ GitHub Sync and Update Rules

- Always **pull** the latest project state before starting work.
- After finishing a task:
  - **Check project consistency**.
  - **Fix integrations** if needed.
  - **Push** the updated project immediately.
  - **Write clear commit messages** (e.g., "Added prompt validator for artist creation flow").

---

## üß† Self-Learning Principles

All contributions must adhere to these self-learning principles:

- **Data-Driven Improvement**  
  Implement mechanisms to collect, analyze, and learn from performance data.

- **Feedback Loop Integration**  
  Every module should include or connect to feedback loops that enable continuous improvement.

- **Adaptation Mechanisms**  
  Design components to adapt their behavior based on historical performance and changing conditions.

- **Performance Metrics**  
  Include clear metrics for measuring success and identifying areas for improvement.

- **Learning Persistence**  
  Ensure learning outcomes are properly stored and applied to future operations.

- **Incremental Optimization**  
  Support gradual refinement of processes based on accumulated knowledge.

## üõ† Special Reminder for AI Agents

If you are an AI agent contributing to the project:

- **Always review the full project tree before coding**.
- **Adapt to changes** dynamically.
- **Never create isolated or disconnected modules**.
- **Proactively improve** the project when opportunities arise.
- **Maintain production-level standards at all times**.
- **Enhance self-learning capabilities** with each contribution.
- **Document learning mechanisms** thoroughly.

---

## üîç Module Integration Requirements

When integrating modules:

- Ensure clear interfaces between components.
- Document all integration points.
- Implement comprehensive error handling at boundaries.
- Include tests that verify correct integration.
- Design for backward compatibility.
- Consider how the integration supports self-learning goals.
