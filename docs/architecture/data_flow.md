# Data Flow

## Overview
This document describes how data flows through the AI Artist Creation and Management System, detailing the interactions between modules and the transformation of data throughout the artist lifecycle.

## Primary Data Flows

### 1. Artist Creation Flow
```
User Input → Input Handler → LLM Pipeline → Profile Validator → Storage Manager
```

- **User Input**: Initial artist parameters (genre, style, etc.)
- **Input Handler**: Validates and normalizes input data
- **LLM Pipeline**: Expands input into complete artist profile
- **Profile Validator**: Ensures compliance with schema
- **Storage Manager**: Persists profile to storage

### 2. Content Generation Flow
```
Artist Profile → Content Planner → Prompt Generator → LLM Orchestrator → Content Validator → Asset Storage
```

- **Artist Profile**: Source of artist personality and style
- **Content Planner**: Determines what content to create and when
- **Prompt Generator**: Creates specialized prompts based on artist profile
- **LLM Orchestrator**: Interfaces with AI models to generate content
- **Content Validator**: Ensures content aligns with artist profile
- **Asset Storage**: Organizes and stores generated content

### 3. Performance Feedback Loop
```
Published Content → Performance Metrics → Trend Analyzer → Behavior Adapter → Artist Profile
```

- **Published Content**: Content released to platforms
- **Performance Metrics**: Engagement and reception data
- **Trend Analyzer**: Identifies patterns and trends
- **Behavior Adapter**: Recommends profile adjustments
- **Artist Profile**: Updated with new behaviors and preferences

## Data Transformations

### Artist Profile Evolution
1. **Initial Creation**: Basic profile with core attributes
2. **Enrichment**: Addition of detailed backstory and personality
3. **Refinement**: Adjustments based on content performance
4. **Evolution**: Gradual shifts in style and preferences over time

### Content Development
1. **Concept**: Initial idea derived from artist profile
2. **Draft**: Raw content generated by AI models
3. **Refinement**: Adjustments to align with artist style
4. **Finalization**: Production-ready content with metadata
5. **Publication**: Content prepared for specific platforms

## Cross-Module Data Dependencies

### Artist Builder → Artist Flow
- Artist profiles
- Asset directory structure
- Creation reports

### Artist Flow → LLM Orchestrator
- Prompt templates
- Generation parameters
- Validation criteria

### LLM Orchestrator → Artist Flow
- Generated content
- Token usage metrics
- Generation performance data

## Data Storage Locations

### Persistent Storage
- Artist profiles: `/artist_profiles/`
- Generated assets: `/assets/{artist_name}_{artist_id}/`
- Creation reports: `/creation_reports/`

### Temporary Storage
- Draft content: `/tmp/drafts/`
- Processing artifacts: `/tmp/processing/`

## Error Handling and Data Recovery

### Data Validation Failures
1. Validation errors logged to `/logs/validation_errors.log`
2. Invalid data stored in `/error_artifacts/` for analysis
3. Automatic correction attempted where possible

### Process Interruptions
1. Checkpoint data saved periodically
2. Recovery process restarts from last checkpoint
3. Incomplete artifacts cleaned up after successful recovery
