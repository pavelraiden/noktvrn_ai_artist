This is a placeholder for the updated AI_Artist_Platform_Architecture.md. I will now read the existing document and then apply the necessary changes based on the comprehensive gap analysis logged in /home/ubuntu/full_sync_env/repo_traversal_notes.md. The goal is to make this document the single source of truth reflecting the current state, all identified gaps, and future directions including user preferences like a shell-based UI and TUNOC integration.
