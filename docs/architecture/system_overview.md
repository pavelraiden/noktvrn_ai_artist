# System Overview

## Introduction
The AI Artist Creation and Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to generate, manage, and evolve AI-powered virtual music artists. The system creates unique artist profiles with distinct personalities, musical styles, and visual identities, then manages their content creation and social media presence.

## Core Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with several key components:

### 1. Artist Builder
The Artist Builder module is responsible for creating new artist profiles. It handles:
- Profile generation using LLM-based pipelines
- Schema validation and enforcement
- Storage of artist profiles
- Creation of asset directories

### 2. Artist Flow
The Artist Flow module manages the lifecycle of artists, including:
- Content planning and scheduling
- Track generation coordination
- Video content creation
- Social media presence management
- Performance tracking and analytics

### 3. LLM Orchestrator
The LLM Orchestrator provides a unified interface for interacting with various language models:
- Manages API connections to different LLM providers
- Handles prompt engineering and optimization
- Provides fallback mechanisms and error handling
- Tracks token usage and performance metrics

### 4. Scripts and Utilities
Supporting scripts and utilities handle:
- Batch operations
- System maintenance
- Data migration
- Backup and recovery

## Data Flow
The system uses a unidirectional data flow where:
1. Artist profiles are created by the Artist Builder
2. Profiles are consumed by the Artist Flow for content generation
3. Content is created through the LLM Orchestrator
4. Performance data is collected and fed back to improve future generations

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.10+ for core functionality
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Various AI APIs for content generation (OpenAI, Suno.ai, etc.)
- Docker for containerization and deployment

## Scalability Considerations
The system is designed to scale horizontally, with:
- Stateless components that can be replicated
- Database sharding capabilities
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data

## Security Model
- Environment-based configuration
- API key management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for all operations
