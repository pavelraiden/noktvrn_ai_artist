# Refactoring Template

## Overview
This template provides a structured approach for refactoring code in the AI Artist Creation and Management System. Follow this process to ensure clean, maintainable code while preserving functionality.

## Refactoring Analysis

### Current State
Describe the current state of the code:
```
[DESCRIBE CURRENT CODE STATE]
Example: The artist_profile_composer.py file has grown to over 1,000 lines with multiple responsibilities including profile generation, validation, and storage. The code contains duplicated logic, long methods, and unclear naming conventions.
```

### Problems Identified
List the problems with the current implementation:
```
1. Code smell: Large class with multiple responsibilities
2. Code smell: Methods longer than 50 lines
3. Code smell: Duplicated validation logic
4. Maintainability issue: Unclear naming conventions
5. Performance issue: Inefficient data processing
```

### Refactoring Goals
Define clear goals for the refactoring:
```
1. Separate concerns into distinct classes/modules
2. Reduce method size to improve readability
3. Eliminate code duplication
4. Improve naming for clarity
5. Optimize performance bottlenecks
```

## Refactoring Plan

### Code Organization
Describe how you'll reorganize the code:
```
Split artist_profile_composer.py into:
1. profile_generator.py - Responsible for generating profiles
2. profile_validator.py - Responsible for validation
3. profile_storage.py - Responsible for storage
4. profile_composer.py - Orchestrates the above components
```

### Interface Changes
Document any interface changes:
```
Current interface:
- ArtistProfileComposer.create_profile(input_data) -> profile

New interfaces:
- ProfileGenerator.generate(input_data) -> draft_profile
- ProfileValidator.validate(profile) -> validated_profile
- ProfileStorage.store(profile) -> stored_profile
- ProfileComposer.create_profile(input_data) -> profile (unchanged externally)
```

### Dependency Management
Describe how dependencies will be managed:
```
1. Use dependency injection for components
2. Create interfaces (abstract base classes) for each component
3. Use factory pattern for creating component instances
4. Update import statements in dependent modules
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phased Approach
Outline a phased implementation strategy:
```
Phase 1: Extract ProfileValidator without changing behavior
Phase 2: Extract ProfileStorage with proper interfaces
Phase 3: Extract ProfileGenerator and update tests
Phase 4: Refactor ProfileComposer to use new components
Phase 5: Clean up and optimize each component
```

### Code Examples
Provide examples of key refactoring patterns:

```python
# Before: Monolithic class
class ArtistProfileComposer:
    def create_profile(self, input_data):
        # 100+ lines of mixed responsibilities
        # validation, generation, and storage logic all mixed together
        pass

# After: Separated concerns
class ProfileGenerator:
    def generate(self, input_data):
        # Only profile generation logic
        pass

class ProfileValidator:
    def validate(self, profile):
        # Only validation logic
        pass

class ProfileStorage:
    def store(self, profile):
        # Only storage logic
        pass

class ProfileComposer:
    def __init__(self, generator, validator, storage):
        self.generator = generator
        self.validator = validator
        self.storage = storage
        
    def create_profile(self, input_data):
        # Orchestration logic
        draft = self.generator.generate(input_data)
        validated = self.validator.validate(draft)
        return self.storage.store(validated)
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
Describe how you'll maintain test coverage:
```
1. Create unit tests for each new component
2. Maintain existing integration tests
3. Add new tests for edge cases
4. Use test doubles (mocks/stubs) for testing components in isolation
```

### Regression Testing
Outline your regression testing approach:
```
1. Run existing test suite after each phase
2. Create temporary adapter if needed to maintain compatibility
3. Compare outputs of old and new implementations
4. Test with a variety of inputs including edge cases
```

## Documentation Updates

### Code Documentation
Describe code documentation updates:
```
1. Add class and method docstrings to all new components
2. Document the responsibility of each component
3. Add examples to docstrings
4. Update type hints
```

### Development Diary
Add an entry to the development diary:
```
## [DATE] - Refactored Artist Profile Composer

### Challenge
The artist_profile_composer.py file had grown too large with mixed responsibilities, making it difficult to maintain and extend.

### Solution
Refactored into separate components with clear responsibilities:
- ProfileGenerator for creating profiles
- ProfileValidator for validation
- ProfileStorage for persistence
- ProfileComposer for orchestration

### Insights
Separating concerns has made the code more maintainable and testable. Each component can now evolve independently, and the interfaces between them are clearly defined.
```

### Solutions Catalog
Add an entry to the solutions catalog:
```
### Single Responsibility Principle
**Decision**: Refactor large classes to follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

**Rationale**:
- Improves code maintainability
- Enables independent testing of components
- Facilitates parallel development
- Reduces cognitive load when working with the code

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Feature flags within monolithic class: Rejected due to increasing complexity
- Subclassing: Considered but found insufficient for proper separation
```

## Deployment Plan

### Rollout Strategy
Describe your rollout strategy:
```
1. Deploy refactored code to development environment
2. Run comprehensive test suite
3. Deploy to staging with feature flag
4. Compare performance and behavior with previous implementation
5. Gradually roll out to production with monitoring
```

### Monitoring
Outline monitoring for the refactored code:
```
1. Add performance metrics for each component
2. Monitor error rates before and after deployment
3. Set up alerts for unexpected behavior
4. Add logging for component interactions
```

## Follow-up Tasks

### Technical Debt
Identify remaining technical debt:
```
1. Similar refactoring needed for content_generator.py
2. Update documentation to reflect new architecture
3. Create visualization of component interactions
```

### Future Improvements
Suggest future improvements:
```
1. Consider making components pluggable for different strategies
2. Add caching layer for frequently accessed profiles
3. Implement more sophisticated validation rules
4. Create metrics dashboard for component performance
```
