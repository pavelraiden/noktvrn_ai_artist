# Bugfix Template

## Overview
This template provides a structured approach for fixing bugs in the AI Artist Creation and Management System. Follow this process to ensure thorough bug resolution and documentation.

## Bug Analysis

### Bug Description
Provide a clear, concise description of the bug:
```
[DESCRIBE THE BUG HERE]
Example: Artist profiles with special characters in the name cause validation errors during content generation.
```

### Reproduction Steps
List the steps to reproduce the bug:
```
1. Create an artist profile with special characters (e.g., "DJ C#Sharp")
2. Attempt to generate content for this artist
3. Observe validation error in logs
```

### Impact Assessment
Assess the impact of the bug:
```
Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
Scope: [Which modules/functionality are affected]
Users affected: [All/Subset - describe which subset]
Workarounds: [Are there any temporary workarounds?]
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process
Document your investigation process:
```
1. Examined error logs and found ValidationError in content_generator.py
2. Traced execution path from artist profile loading to validation
3. Identified that special characters are not properly escaped in prompt templates
4. Confirmed by testing with manually escaped characters
```

### Root Cause
Identify the root cause of the bug:
```
[DESCRIBE ROOT CAUSE HERE]
Example: The prompt template engine does not escape special characters when inserting artist names into templates, causing syntax errors in the resulting prompts.
```

## Fix Implementation

### Proposed Solution
Describe your proposed solution:
```
[DESCRIBE SOLUTION HERE]
Example: Implement a character escaping function in the prompt template engine that properly handles special characters in artist names and other fields.
```

### Code Changes
List the files that need to be modified:
```
1. llm_orchestrator/prompt_engine.py - Add escaping function
2. llm_orchestrator/template_processor.py - Call escaping function before inserting values
3. llm_orchestrator/test_prompt_engine.py - Add tests for special character handling
```

### Implementation Details
Provide implementation details:
```python
# Before:
def insert_value(template, key, value):
    return template.replace(f"{{{key}}}", value)

# After:
def escape_special_chars(value):
    # Escape special characters that could break prompt syntax
    special_chars = ['#', '*', '`', '\\', '>', '<', '|']
    result = str(value)
    for char in special_chars:
        result = result.replace(char, f"\\{char}")
    return result

def insert_value(template, key, value):
    escaped_value = escape_special_chars(value)
    return template.replace(f"{{{key}}}", escaped_value)
```

## Testing

### Test Cases
List test cases to verify the fix:
```
1. Test with artist name containing # character
2. Test with artist name containing * character
3. Test with artist name containing multiple special characters
4. Test with very long artist names
5. Test with non-ASCII characters
```

### Regression Testing
Describe regression testing to ensure no new issues:
```
1. Run existing test suite to verify no regressions
2. Test content generation with normal artist profiles
3. Test with edge cases (empty strings, very long strings)
```

## Documentation

### Update Development Diary
Add an entry to the development diary:
```
## [DATE] - Fixed Special Character Handling in Prompt Templates

### Challenge
Artist profiles with special characters caused validation errors during content generation.

### Solution
Implemented proper character escaping in the prompt template engine to handle special characters in artist names and other fields.

### Insights
Special character handling is critical for user-generated content that flows into structured templates. We should implement similar escaping in other areas where user input is used in structured contexts.
```

### Update Lessons Learned
Add an entry to the lessons learned document:
```
### Input Sanitization
**Challenge**: Special characters in user input caused errors in downstream processing.

**Lesson**: Always sanitize and escape user input before using it in structured contexts.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement consistent escaping functions for different contexts (prompts, SQL, etc.)
- Add validation for user input at the entry point
- Test with a wide range of special characters and edge cases
```

## Deployment

### Deployment Plan
Outline the deployment plan:
```
1. Submit pull request with fix
2. Request code review from team members
3. Run automated test suite
4. Deploy to staging environment for validation
5. Monitor for any issues
6. Deploy to production during next release window
```

### Monitoring
Describe monitoring for the fix:
```
1. Add specific logging for character escaping operations
2. Monitor error rates for prompt generation
3. Set up alerts for any validation errors in prompt templates
```

## Follow-up

### Related Issues
Identify any related issues that should be addressed:
```
1. Similar escaping may be needed in social media post generation
2. Consider adding a general input sanitization layer
3. Review other areas where user input flows into structured templates
```

### Preventive Measures
Suggest preventive measures to avoid similar bugs:
```
1. Add automated tests for special character handling
2. Create a central utility for text sanitization and escaping
3. Add validation rules to the artist profile schema
4. Update code review checklist to include input sanitization checks
```
