Provide a clear, concise description of the bug:
```
[DESCRIBE THE BUG HERE]
Example: Artist profiles with special characters in the name cause validation errors during content generation.
```

### Reproduction Steps
List the steps to reproduce the bug:
```
1. Create an artist profile with special characters (e.g., "DJ C#Sharp")
2. Attempt to generate content for this artist
3. Observe validation error in logs
```

### Impact Assessment
Assess the impact of the bug:

```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process
Document your investigation process:
```
1. Examined error logs and found ValidationError in content_generator.py
2. Traced execution path from artist profile loading to validation
3. Identified that special characters are not properly escaped in prompt templates
4. Confirmed by testing with manually escaped characters
5. Analyzed metrics to determine frequency and pattern of occurrences
```

### Root Cause
Identify the root cause of the bug:
```
[DESCRIBE ROOT CAUSE HERE]
Example: The prompt template engine does not escape special characters when inserting artist names into templates, causing syntax errors in the resulting prompts.
```

### Pattern Recognition
Identify if this bug is part of a larger pattern:
```
[DESCRIBE PATTERN IF APPLICABLE]
Example: This is part of a pattern where user-provided input is not properly sanitized before being used in structured contexts. Similar issues have been found in social media post generation and image prompt creation.
```

## Fix Implementation

### Proposed Solution
Describe your proposed solution:
```
[DESCRIBE SOLUTION HERE]
Example: Implement a character escaping function in the prompt template engine that properly handles special characters in artist names and other fields.
```

### Self-Learning Enhancement
Describe how the fix incorporates self-learning principles:
```
[DESCRIBE SELF-LEARNING ENHANCEMENT]
Example: Add metrics collection to track special character handling success rates. Implement adaptive escaping that learns from successful and failed escaping patterns to improve over time.
```

### Code Changes
List the files that need to be modified:
```
1. llm_orchestrator/prompt_engine.py - Add escaping function and metrics collection

4. llm_orchestrator/test_prompt_engine.py - Add tests for special character handling
```

### Implementation Details
Provide implementation details:
```python
# Before:
def insert_value(template, key, value):
    return template.replace(f"{{{key}}}", value)

# After:
def escape_special_chars(value, context=None):
    # Initialize metrics tracking
    metrics = MetricsCollector()
    operation_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Get adaptive escaping patterns if available
    escaping_patterns = character_adapter.get_adapted_patterns(context)
    
    # Escape special characters that could break prompt syntax
    special_chars = escaping_patterns.get('special_chars', ['#', '*', '`', '\\', '>', '<', '|'])
    result = str(value)
    
    try:
        for char in special_chars:
            result = result.replace(char, escaping_patterns.get(char, f"\\{char}"))
        
        # Record success metrics
        duration_ms = int((time.time() - start_time) * 1000)
        metrics.record_operation(
            operation="escape_special_chars",
            status=OperationStatus.SUCCESS,
            duration_ms=duration_ms,
            context={"original_length": len(str(value)), "operation_id": operation_id}
        )
        
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        # Record failure metrics
        duration_ms = int((time.time() - start_time) * 1000)
        metrics.record_operation(
            operation="escape_special_chars",
            status=OperationStatus.FAILURE,
            duration_ms=duration_ms,
            context={"original_length": len(str(value)), "operation_id": operation_id},
            error=str(e)
        )
        # Fall back to basic escaping
        return basic_escape(value)

def insert_value(template, key, value, context=None):
    context = context or {}
    context["template_key"] = key
    escaped_value = escape_special_chars(value, context)
    return template.replace(f"{{{key}}}", escaped_value)
```

## [DATE] - Fixed Special Character Handling in Prompt Templates

### Challenge
Artist profiles with special characters caused validation errors during content generation.

### Solution
Implemented proper character escaping in the prompt template engine to handle special characters in artist names and other fields.

### Self-Learning Enhancement
Added metrics collection and adaptive escaping that learns from successful patterns to improve over time. The system now tracks which characters cause issues and automatically adjusts escaping strategies based on success rates.

### Insights
Special character handling is critical for user-generated content that flows into structured templates. We should implement similar escaping in other areas where user input is used in structured contexts. The adaptive approach allows the system to handle new special characters without explicit programming.
```

### Update Lessons Learned
Add an entry to the lessons learned document:
```
### Input Sanitization with Self-Learning
**Challenge**: Special characters in user input caused errors in downstream processing.

**Lesson**: Always sanitize and escape user input before using it in structured contexts, and implement self-learning mechanisms to improve sanitization over time.

**Self-Learning Approach**:
- Collect metrics on sanitization success/failure
- Identify patterns in problematic inputs
- Adapt sanitization strategies based on performance data
- Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement

**Recommendation**:
- Implement consistent escaping functions with metrics collection
- Add adaptive mechanisms that learn from past failures
- Test with a wide range of special characters and edge cases
- Monitor adaptation effectiveness over time
```

## Deployment

### Deployment Plan
Outline the deployment plan:
```
1. Submit pull request with fix and self-learning enhancements
2. Request code review from team members
3. Run automated test suite including adaptation tests
4. Deploy to staging environment for validation
5. Monitor metrics collection and adaptation for 48 hours
6. Deploy to production during next release window
7. Set up alerts for adaptation effectiveness
```

### Monitoring
Describe monitoring for the fix:
```
1. Add specific logging for character escaping operations
2. Monitor error rates for prompt generation
3. Set up alerts for any validation errors in prompt templates
4. Track adaptation metrics over time
5. Create dashboard for escaping performance and learning effectiveness
```

## Follow-up

### Related Issues
Identify any related issues that should be addressed:
```
1. Similar escaping may be needed in social media post generation
2. Consider adding a general input sanitization layer
3. Review other areas where user input flows into structured templates
4. Implement similar self-learning approaches in related modules
```

### Preventive Measures
Suggest preventive measures to avoid similar bugs:
```
1. Add automated tests for special character handling
2. Create a central utility for text sanitization and escaping with adaptation capabilities
3. Add validation rules to the artist profile schema
4. Update code review checklist to include input sanitization checks
5. Implement system-wide metrics for input handling success rates
6. Create regular reviews of adaptation effectiveness
```

### Learning System Enhancement
Suggest improvements to the learning system based on this bug:
```
1. Connect character escaping metrics to the central learning system
2. Implement cross-module pattern recognition for input handling issues
3. Create a shared knowledge base of problematic input patterns
4. Develop predictive models for identifying potential input handling issues
5. Implement automated testing based on learned problematic patterns
```
