# Project State Summary (April 29, 2025)

This document provides a concise overview of the AI Artist Creation and Management System's current state following the completion of Phase 1 (Real Data Integration & Database Implementation) and a repository audit.

## 1. Implemented Modules & Core Functionality

*   **Database Infrastructure (PostgreSQL):**
    *   Server setup and configuration.
    *   Database (`ai_artist_db`) and user (`ai_artist_user`) created.
    *   Connection management with pooling (`database/connection_manager.py`).
    *   Schemas defined and applied for core tables (`artist_profiles`, `tracks`, `country_profiles`, `performance_metrics`, `trend_analysis`, `competitor_analysis`, `evolution_plans`).
*   **API Clients:**
    *   Spotify API client implemented (`api_clients/spotify_client.py`) for fetching chart/track/feature data.
    *   Framework exists for adding other clients (e.g., Apple Music).
    *   Older clients (Suno, Pexels, Pixabay) exist in `scripts/` (pending consolidation).
*   **Data Pipelines (Initial):**
    *   Spotify charts pipeline (`data_pipelines/spotify_charts_pipeline.py`) implemented to fetch, transform, and load chart/track data into PostgreSQL.
*   **Artist Builder (Core & Evolution Components):**
    *   Modules for various aspects of artist evolution exist (self-learning analysis, competitor analysis, profile evolution, prompt adaptation, country strategy).
    *   These modules were designed and implemented using *mock data* in the previous phase.
*   **Audio Analysis:**
    *   Feature extraction logic exists (`artist_builder/audio_analysis/feature_extractor.py`).
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Initial READMEs for `database`, `api_clients`.
    *   Updated root `README.md` and `system_overview.md`.
    *   Various design documents and previous implementation reports exist.

## 2. What is Ready?

*   **Core Database Structure:** The PostgreSQL database is set up with the necessary tables to store all critical system data.
*   **Basic Data Ingestion:** The system can fetch Spotify chart and track data via the API client and store it in the database using the initial data pipeline.
*   **Foundation for Evolution:** The modular structure for trend analysis, self-learning, strategic planning, and adaptation implementation is in place (though currently operating on mock data or not fully connected).
*   **API Connectivity:** Proven ability to connect to and retrieve data from Spotify, Suno, Pexels, Pixabay.

## 3. What is Missing or Placeholder?

*   **Full Data Pipeline Implementation:** The current Spotify pipeline is basic. Needs expansion (more countries, error handling, scheduling, other sources like Apple Music), and pipelines for performance metrics and competitor data need implementation.
*   **Real Data Integration into Evolution Logic:** Modules like `SelfLearningAnalyzer`, `CompetitorTrendAnalyzer`, `ArtistEvolutionManager`, etc., need to be refactored to read from/write to the PostgreSQL database instead of using mock data.
*   **LLM Integration:** Components like `ProfileEvolutionManager` and `PromptAdaptationPipeline` are not yet connected to actual LLM APIs. The `LLMOrchestrator` needs full implementation and integration.
*   **Performance Metrics Source:** The source and pipeline for collecting actual track performance metrics (streams, engagement) are undefined.
*   **UI/Dashboard:** No user interface exists for managing artists or viewing analytics.
*   **Content Generation Workflow:** The `ArtistFlow` module needs full implementation to orchestrate the end-to-end content generation process using the database and adapted prompts.
*   **Repository Cleanup:** Output directories (`artists/`, `assets/`, etc.) and temporary task directories need cleanup/relocation. API clients in `scripts/` need consolidation.
*   **Refinement & Tuning:** Analysis algorithms and adaptation logic require tuning based on real data.

## 4. Requirements for Next Phase (Phase 2: LLM Integration & Refinement)

*   **LLM API Access:** Credentials and potentially budget for interacting with chosen LLM provider(s) (e.g., OpenAI).
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Development and refinement of prompts for profile evolution and content generation adaptation.
*   **Refactoring:** Update evolution-related modules (`Artist Builder` submodules) to use the PostgreSQL database.
*   **LLM Orchestrator Implementation:** Build out the orchestrator to manage LLM interactions, including handling adapted prompts.
*   **Integration:** Connect `ProfileEvolutionManager` and `PromptAdaptationPipeline` to the `LLMOrchestrator`.
*   **Testing:** Develop tests for LLM interactions and the refined evolution loop using real database data.
