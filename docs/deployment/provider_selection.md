# Hosting Provider Selection

## Decision

The selected hosting provider for the AI Artist Platform production deployment is **Vultr**.

## Rationale

Comparative analysis of hosting providers (e.g., Hetzner, Vultr, AWS) was initially planned based on criteria such as cost, performance, scalability, and PostgreSQL support.

However, during the initial planning phase, the user provided explicit instructions to utilize Vultr, stating that the service is already paid for.

Therefore, the decision to use Vultr is based directly on this user requirement, prioritizing the use of existing resources and bypassing the need for further comparative evaluation.

All subsequent infrastructure planning and deployment configurations will be tailored specifically for the Vultr cloud environment.
