# Phase 10.2: Production Server Deployment (Vultr) - Final Report

**Date:** 2025-05-02

**Status:** Complete (Scripts & Documentation Generated for Manual Execution)

## Summary

This phase focused on preparing the AI Artist Platform for deployment onto the provisioned Vultr server (IP: `136.244.94.146`). Due to limitations preventing direct SSH access from my environment, the approach shifted to generating a comprehensive set of scripts, configuration files, and documentation to enable manual execution by the user.

## Key Actions & Deliverables

1.  **Vultr Server Provisioning & Firewall:**
    *   Successfully provisioned a Vultr instance (ID: `b2da6c8c-e560-48f7-bcb8-21717bd15bea`) with 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 80GB SSD in Frankfurt (fra), using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (deviation from 22.04 due to availability).
    *   Created a Vultr firewall group (`ai-artist-fw`, ID: `217b9ff1-b244-43be-ac5f-7f238844d905`) and added rules via API to allow SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443).

2.  **Deployment Scripts & Configuration Files:**
    *   Generated shell scripts for manual execution on the server:
        *   `deployment/01_initial_setup_python.sh`: Installs Python 3.11, Git, and prerequisites.
        *   `deployment/02_install_configure_postgres.sh`: Installs PostgreSQL, creates DB/user, and sets up daily backups.
        *   `deployment/03_security_hardening.sh`: Configures UFW, Fail2ban, and hardens SSH.
        *   `deployment/04_logging_setup.sh`: Creates log directory and configures logrotate.
        *   `deployment/05_testing_validation.sh`: Provides a step-by-step guide for testing the deployed application.
    *   Created configuration files:
        *   `deployment/nginx_ai_artist.conf`: Nginx reverse proxy configuration (HTTP/HTTPS, self-signed SSL placeholder).
        *   `deployment/gunicorn_config.py`: Gunicorn configuration for the Flask frontend.
        *   `deployment/ai_artist_frontend.service` & `deployment/ai_artist_backend.service`: Systemd service files for auto-starting frontend and backend.
        *   `deployment/env.production.template`: `.env` template populated with provided production API keys (requires DB password and Flask secret key update).
    *   Created Admin Dashboard files:
        *   `deployment/admin_dashboard.html`: HTML template for the dashboard.
        *   `deployment/dashboard.js`: JavaScript for handling artist status updates via API.

3.  **Documentation:**
    *   Created a detailed manual deployment guide: `docs/deployment.md`.
    *   Updated `todo.md` throughout the process.

4.  **GitHub Synchronization:**
    *   Committed and pushed all generated scripts, configurations, and documentation to the `pavelraiden/noktvrn_ai_artist` repository.

## Next Steps (Manual Execution Required)

The user needs to SSH into the Vultr server (`136.244.94.146`) and follow the instructions in `docs/deployment.md` to:

1.  Run the generated setup and configuration scripts (`01` to `04`).
2.  Clone the repository.
3.  Set up the Python virtual environment and install dependencies.
4.  Create and secure the `.env` file using the template, ensuring the correct DB password and a new Flask secret key are set.
5.  Configure and enable Nginx, Gunicorn, and Systemd services using the provided files (adjusting paths as necessary).
6.  Perform testing and validation using the `05_testing_validation.sh` guide.
7.  Optionally set up Let's Encrypt SSL if a domain name is used.

## Conclusion

All necessary configurations, scripts, and documentation for deploying the AI Artist Platform to the Vultr production server have been generated and pushed to the repository. The system is ready for manual deployment following the provided guide (`docs/deployment.md`).
