# Phase 10.1: Production Server Setup & Infrastructure Deployment - Final Report

## Summary

This report summarizes the completion of Phase 10.1, focusing on setting up the production infrastructure plan for the AI Artist Platform on Vultr.

## Key Actions Completed:

1.  **Provider Selection:** Vultr was selected as the hosting provider based on explicit user instruction due to pre-payment. Rationale documented in `docs/deployment/provider_selection.md`.
2.  **Infrastructure Planning:** Defined a scalable infrastructure plan on Vultr to support 100-300 artists, including:
    *   Optimized Cloud Compute instances for the backend.
    *   A smaller instance for the Flask frontend dashboard.
    *   Vultr Managed Database for PostgreSQL (HA configuration recommended).
    *   Vultr Object Storage for media assets.
    *   Networking configuration using VPC, Load Balancers (optional), and Firewalls.
    *   Detailed specifications and rationale documented in `docs/deployment/infra_setup.md`.
3.  **Estimated Costs:** Provided a rough monthly cost estimate ranging from **~$129 - $217**, based on the proposed Vultr infrastructure (details in `infra_setup.md`).
4.  **Deployment Configuration:** Created Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`) and Dockerfile (`backend.Dockerfile`, `frontend.Dockerfile`) configurations in the `/deployment/` directory to containerize the backend, frontend, and database services.
5.  **Artist Lifecycle Control:** Implemented the backend API endpoints and database model (`Artist` model, `/api/artists` routes) within the Flask frontend application to support Start/Pause functionality. *Note: Frontend UI integration for these controls is pending implementation.*
6.  **Security:** Ensured configurations use environment variables for secrets (`.env` file), planned firewall rules, and recommended security best practices (documented in `infra_setup.md`).
7.  **Documentation:** Updated relevant documentation (`infra_setup.md`, `provider_selection.md`) and created necessary deployment files.
8.  **Code Synchronization:** Committed all changes and successfully pushed them to the `main` branch of the `pavelraiden/noktvrn_ai_artist` GitHub repository.

## Deliverables:

Attached are the key documents and configuration files created during this phase:

*   Infrastructure Plan: `docs/deployment/infra_setup.md`
*   Provider Selection Rationale: `docs/deployment/provider_selection.md`
*   Deployment Configuration: `deployment/docker-compose.yml`, `deployment/backend.Dockerfile`, `deployment/frontend.Dockerfile`
*   Final Todo List: `todo.md`

## Next Steps:

The infrastructure is planned, and deployment configurations are prepared. Actual provisioning of Vultr resources, deployment using the Docker configurations, frontend UI implementation for lifecycle control, and thorough end-to-end testing are the subsequent steps required to bring the platform online.
