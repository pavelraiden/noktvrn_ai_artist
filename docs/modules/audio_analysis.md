# Audio Analysis Module Documentation

## Overview

The Audio Analysis module is a core component of the AI Artist Creation and Management System that enables deep understanding of musical content. This module extracts and analyzes musical features from audio files, providing insights that inform artist evolution, trend analysis, and content generation.

## Features

- **Feature Extraction**: Extract temporal, spectral, harmonic, and high-level features from audio files
- **Style Analysis**: Analyze musical styles, calculate similarity, and identify style elements
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify musical trends, track their evolution, and predict future trends
- **Artist Evolution Integration**: Generate recommendations for artist adaptation based on audio analysis

## Components

### Feature Extractor

The Feature Extractor processes audio files and extracts a comprehensive set of musical features:

- **Temporal Features**: Tempo (BPM), beat positions, rhythm patterns, onset detection
- **Spectral Features**: Spectral centroid, bandwidth, contrast, rolloff, MFCCs
- **Harmonic Features**: Key and scale detection, chord progression analysis, tonal centroid
- **High-level Features**: Energy level, mood classification, danceability, acousticness

### Style Analyzer

The Style Analyzer processes extracted features to understand musical styles:

- **Genre Classification**: Identifies musical genres based on feature patterns
- **Similarity Analysis**: Calculates similarity between different tracks
- **Style Element Identification**: Extracts key style elements like mood, complexity, and instrumentation
- **Trend Compatibility**: Analyzes how compatible a track is with current trends

### Trend Analyzer

The Trend Analyzer processes collections of features to identify and predict trends:

- **Trend Identification**: Calculates aggregate statistics across multiple tracks
- **Evolution Tracking**: Monitors how trends change over time
- **Future Prediction**: Predicts future trend directions based on historical data

### Audio Analysis Integrator

The Audio Analysis Integrator connects the audio analysis system with the artist evolution system:

- **Track Analysis**: Analyzes individual tracks for evolution recommendations
- **Catalog Analysis**: Analyzes collections of tracks to identify trends
- **Adaptation Planning**: Generates adaptation plans for artists based on trend analysis

## Usage Examples

### Extracting Features from an Audio File

```python
from artist_builder.audio_analysis.feature_extractor import FeatureExtractor

extractor = FeatureExtractor()
features = extractor.extract_features("path/to/audio.mp3")

# Access specific features
tempo = features["temporal"]["tempo"]
key = features["harmonic"]["key"]
energy = features["high_level"]["energy_level"]
```

### Analyzing Musical Style

```python
from artist_builder.audio_analysis.style_analyzer import StyleAnalyzer

analyzer = StyleAnalyzer()
style_elements = analyzer.identify_style_elements(features)
genre = analyzer.classify_genre(features)

print(f"Genre: {genre['primary_genre']}")
print(f"Mood: {style_elements['mood']}")
```

### Analyzing Trends

```python
from artist_builder.audio_analysis.trend_analyzer import TrendAnalyzer

analyzer = TrendAnalyzer()
trends = analyzer.identify_current_trends(features_collection)
evolution = analyzer.track_trend_evolution(trends)
predictions = analyzer.predict_future_trends()
```

### Integrating with Artist Evolution

```python
from artist_builder.audio_analysis.integration import AudioAnalysisIntegrator

integrator = AudioAnalysisIntegrator()

# Analyze a track for evolution recommendations
analysis = integrator.analyze_track_for_evolution(audio_path, artist_profile)

# Generate an adaptation plan based on trend analysis
adaptation_plan = integrator.generate_artist_adaptation_plan(artist_profile, trend_analysis)
```

## Integration Points

The Audio Analysis module integrates with several other components of the AI Artist Creation and Management System:

1. **Artist Builder**: Provides audio analysis to inform artist profile creation
2. **Artist Evolution**: Guides artist evolution based on trend analysis
3. **Content Generation**: Informs music generation with style and trend insights
4. **Performance Analytics**: Feeds audio features into performance analysis

## Technical Details

- **Implementation**: Python with librosa for audio processing
- **Data Format**: JSON-based feature representation
- **Storage**: Feature data stored alongside artist profiles
- **Performance**: Optimized for batch processing of audio files

## Dependencies

- librosa: Audio processing and feature extraction
- numpy: Numerical operations
- scipy: Scientific computing
- pandas: Data manipulation

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with Essentia for more advanced audio analysis
- Deep learning-based genre and mood classification
- Real-time analysis capabilities
- Cross-modal analysis (audio-visual correlations)
- User feedback incorporation into analysis
