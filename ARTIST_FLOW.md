## Stage 1: Profile Generation & Voice Synthesis

The first stage in the artist lifecycle is the creation of a comprehensive artist profile, including a unique voice sample.

### Process

1.  **Initial Prompt Collection**
    *   System receives basic artist concept (genre, style, themes).
    *   Optional constraints are defined (target audience, influences, era).

2.  **Profile Draft Generation**
    *   LLM generates initial artist profile draft.
    *   Includes name, backstory, musical style, visual aesthetic, LLM config.

3.  **Profile Validation**
    *   Validator checks for coherence and completeness.
    *   Ensures all required fields are populated.
    *   Verifies consistency between elements (e.g., visual style matches musical genre).

4.  **Feedback Loop Processing**
    *   Any validation issues trigger refinement.
    *   Multiple iterations may occur until profile meets quality standards.

5.  **Final Profile Assembly & Database Storage**
    *   Complete artist profile is assembled.
    *   Profile is stored in the database with unique identifier and `Candidate` status.

6.  **Voice Synthesis (via VoiceService)**
    *   A short text sample is generated based on the artist's name.
    *   The `VoiceService` (using ElevenLabs API with mock fallback) generates a unique voice sample.
    *   The URL of the generated voice sample (`voice_url`) is saved to the artist's database record.

7.  **Initial Asset Generation**
    *   Initial artist assets are generated (profile image, logo, etc.).

### Outputs

*   Complete artist profile JSON document (including `voice_url`).
*   Artist visual identity assets.
*   Artist database entry.
*   Generated voice sample (stored externally, URL in DB).

## Stage 2: First Release Creation (Candidate Run)

Once an artist profile is established (as a `Candidate`), the system creates the artist's first music release to evaluate its potential.

### Process

1.  **Track Concept Generation**
    *   System generates track concept based on artist profile (genre, style notes).
    *   Includes style, mood, tempo, themes, and lyrical direction.
    *   A/B testing variations might be applied to parameters like the music prompt.

2.  **Music Generation & Analysis (via BeatService)**
    *   The `BeatService` orchestrates music generation.
    *   It attempts generation using the primary API (e.g., aimlapi.com) with configured models and fallback logic.
    *   If the primary API fails, it falls back to an alternative API (e.g., Replicate MusicGen, currently mocked).
    *   The generated audio track URL and model used are recorded.
    *   The `BeatService` then uses the `AudioAnalyzer` (librosa) to download and analyze the generated track, extracting tempo (BPM) and duration (seconds).

3.  **Lyrics Generation (via LyricsService)**
    *   The `LyricsService` uses the LLM Orchestrator to generate lyrics.
    *   The prompt includes the track concept, genre, style notes, and crucially, the **tempo and duration** obtained from the `BeatService` analysis to guide the LLM.

4.  **Video Selection**
    *   Keywords derived from the artist profile and track concept are used.
    *   APIs like Pexels and Pixabay are queried (with fallback) to find a suitable background video.
    *   The selected video URL and source are recorded.

5.  **Audio Post-Processing (via ProductionService)**
    *   The generated music track URL is passed to the `ProductionService`.
    *   The `humanize_audio` method applies effects like normalization and subtle background noise overlay (using pydub).
    *   The URL/path of the processed audio is returned (currently a local file path).
    *   *Note: This processed audio is not yet integrated into the final video in this flow.* 

6.  **Preview Assembly & Approval Request**
    *   A preview package (including track URL, lyrics, video URL) is assembled.
    *   The `TelegramService` sends this preview to the designated channel/user for approval.
    *   The system waits for an 'approved' or 'rejected' status update via the run status file.

7.  **Outcome Processing**
    *   **Approved:** The `ReleaseChain` service is triggered to process the approved run data (metadata compilation, potential future packaging/upload steps).
    *   **Rejected/Timeout:** The release is skipped.

8.  **Performance Update & Reflection**
    *   The artist's performance history in the database is updated with the run outcome ('approved' or 'rejected').
    *   Consecutive rejections are tracked.
    *   The LLM Orchestrator reflects on the run (profile, parameters, outcome) to suggest potential adjustments to the artist's `style_notes` or `llm_config`.
    *   These suggestions are applied to the artist's database record.

9.  **Lifecycle Evaluation (via ArtistLifecycleManager)**
    *   The `ArtistLifecycleManager` evaluates the artist's status based on performance (e.g., consecutive rejections).
    *   A `Candidate` artist might be promoted to `Active` after an approval or retired after too many rejections.

### Outputs

*   Generated music track (raw and potentially processed).
*   Generated lyrics aligned with track concept (and potentially timing).
*   Selected background video.
*   Run data including parameters, generated asset URLs, outcome, and reflection suggestions.
*   Updated artist database entry (performance history, potentially status, style notes, LLM config).
*   (If approved) Input for the `ReleaseChain` process.
